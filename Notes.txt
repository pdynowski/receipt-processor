Some notes on development:

1. Why two apps?
- Ruby and Rails are the language and framework I'm used to working in, so I wanted to do the exercise in that to show how I work in a framework that I'm familiar with.
- I've never touched Go before, but it's what is generally used at Fetch, so I wanted to start picking it up and show that I can work in it/be productive in it quickly.

2. Why Redis for the Rails app?
- It's not Ruby/Railslike to have global variables (there's no easy analogue to the receipts array from the Go app), so things have to be persisted somewhere
- Redis is pretty lightweight, and doesn't create an enormous container/require a lot of setup
- I wanted to show off my Docker skills a little
